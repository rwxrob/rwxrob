# Random Thoughts

## I never needed a zettelkasten

Ya know, I don't need a zettelkastenâ€”especially now that I have Chloe (my AI) to help me get good answers to things as fast as possible.

Everything I would ever want to write down falls into one of the following categories, all covered by existing systems that are much better:

- **Random thoughts**: best in a single running log file, like this one
- **Educational**: best in [Code-Mage] or or [Autodidactic] books
- **Tech tips**: best in a dynamic book like [Terminal Velocity]
- **Project news and notes**: best in the GitHub project or a pinned issue
- **Multimedia**: best on YouTube and other media hosting sites
- **Polished articles**: best in dynamic book, appendix, or maybe blog

People will be able to see how my thinking as changed just by looking at the version diffs of this file over time. A single file makes it easier to manage as well since there does not need to be a system at all. Search is entirely covered by GitHub itself. And people can chime in on thoughts by opening issues or adding a comment to the comments issue.
