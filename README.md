Hello Friend. There's a good chance we've met, probably on my [livestream](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) or at one of my live presentations or maybe at SKILSTAK, a learning community I founded with my own retirement money to address the critical lack of tech skills education in America. If we haven't met, I look forward to it. You are probably here for one of the following:

📚 [Perpetually unfinished books](https://github.com/rwxrob/books)

🌳 [Go Bonzai CLI framework and library](https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai)  
🏆 [Awesome Go](https://github.com/rwxrob/awesome-go)
