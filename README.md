Hello Friend. There's a good chance we've met, probably on my [livestream](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) or at one of my live presentations or maybe at SKILSTAK, a learning community I founded with my own retirement money to address the critical lack of tech skills education in America. If we haven't met, I look forward to it.

Star and watch [this repo](https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob) to be notified of activity. Your [support](https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob) and [nice comments](https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob/discussions/categories/nice-things) are appreciated more than I can say. Here [you can find me](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob), [read news and annoucements](https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob/discussions/categories/announcements) or know my latest [random thoughts](https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob/tree/main/thoughts#readme).

We really can save the world, one changed life at a time.
