Hello Friend. There's a good chance we've met, probably on my [livestream](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) or at one of my live presentations or maybe at SKILSTAK.
If we haven't met, I look forward to it. Be sure to star and follow any of the following if you want to be informed of updates, which you can optionally have emailed to you. Your [support](https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob) and [nice comments](https://github.com/rwxrob/nice) are always appreciated. Socials are on https://linktr.ee/rwxrob.
