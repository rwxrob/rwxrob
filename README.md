Hello Friend. There's a good chance we've met, probably on my [livestream](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) or at one of my live presentations or maybe at SKILSTAK, a learning community I founded with my own retirement money to address the critical lack of tech skills education in America. If we haven't met, I look forward to it. My work speaks for itself. Your [support](https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob) and [nice comments](https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob/issues/1) are appreciated more than I can say. Here's [where you can find me](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) or [read news about me](https://github.com/rwxrob/issues/2). We really can save the world, one changed life at a time.
