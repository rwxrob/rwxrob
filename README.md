Hello Friend. There's a good chance we've already met, probably on my [livestream](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) or at one of my live presentations or maybe at SKILSTAK, a learning community I founded with my own retirement money to address the critical needs for tech skills education in America. If we haven't met, I look forward to it. My work speaks for itself. Your support is appreciated more than I can say. We really can save the world, one changed life at a time.
