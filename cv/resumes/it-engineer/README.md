# Resume for IT Infrastructure Engineer / Senior Software Developer

Here is my resume targeted at my core IT proficiencies, infrastructure
engineering, operations, and systems software design and development.

The PDF is created with Firefox with all the extras disabled and has
been tested to ensure it contains transferable fonts.

This resume is built from [YAML structured data](data.yml) (which is
drawn from the CV) and generated from [templates](tmpl) in Go
(golang) `html/template` syntax. To generate the `index.html` file from
updated `tmpl` simply do `go run gen.go` from within this
directory.

You may find it useful to recreate this setup for your own resumes.
