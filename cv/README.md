# Robert Sterling Muhlestein, Curriculum Vitae

*This stuff is never current since I don't like doxing my current employer.*

[[*Here's the last resume I submitted to anyone.*]](resumes/it-engineer/rob-muhlestein.pdf)

Content for this CV is (mostly) contained in the [data.yml](data.yml),
which can be queried, filtered, and used to generate different views.
Hence, its length and lack of specificity. Recruiters and employers
often prefer a broader view of my personal and professional life in
order to make their own decisions about which elements to focus on
rather than have me choose.
