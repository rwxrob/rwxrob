    Robert is a very skilled programmer. His ability to come up with
    solutions to problems enables them to be resolved faster.  I worked
    with him as a Systems Administrator. He was able to use his skills
    to automate many of the processes that made work much easier for the
    rest of the team. His zeal for coding prompted other team members to
    strengthen and/or learn programming skills.

    I want to thank you for all of the amazing information & resources
    that are available here on your site.  It is always a pleasure when
    I come here and see a new blog post -- even (especially) when the
    subject matter goes over my head -- it shows how much room I have to
    grow.)  I have been visiting your site semi-frequently throughout
    the year.  It is amazing and encouraging to see how passionate you
    are about getting others to understand technology on a deeper level.

    I am a web developer who did not take the traditional college path
    to get where I am (boot camp grad, please don't hold that against
    me). When I visit SkilStak I view it as being like a path of
    breadcrumbs leading me to the things that are important and that
    I should be focusing my time & effort on learning.  You have my
    gratitude for so freely sharing such a vast amount of info, often in
    areas that reveal to me where my tech "blind spots" are so that
    I may delve deeper.  My goal for 2020 is to have my personal website
    up & running.  SkilStak has been a big inspiration on my finally
    putting in some work towards that goal.

    Thank you for creating this amazing space for those of us who would
    otherwise have never met you in person.  Keep up the incredible
    work!

    PS - You may recall that we had a brief Twitter exchange several
    months ago.  I have been learning to do more on the terminal than
    ever before, but I am still hoping for and looking forward to an
    eventual Terminal Master course!  Until then I will be following the
    book you recommend here (Learning the Linux Command Line, complete
    with Bash v4 - I installed Ubuntu last week and I can't wait to
    become a true terminal master!)

    Hi there. Just read you bad parent blog piece. You lost skilstak in
    your medium/twitter handle so I thought I’d see what it is. Broken
    by the looks of it. Good in you for becoming an educator. It’s not
    easy but I hope it’s rewarding.

    Hi Rob - No reason for my email other than to say thank you for
    everything you do for [our son]! He absolutely loves coding and his
    hour with you is his favorite of the week. He spends his free time
    working through the problems you help him come up with and he knows
    what he wants to do with his life. We are so happy he has found
    something he loves and just wanted to say thanks!"

    I have been with SkilStak for about 6 years now and it has been one
    of the most valuable and impactful experiences in my life. I feel
    that Mr. Rob has trained me extremely well and I feel prepared for
    my future in programming and engineering. Mr. Rob has done so many
    things for me over the years and caused me to get a extremely
    valuable payed internship before I even finished High School, not to
    mention multiple job offers with 6 digit salaries. I highly
    recommend SkilStak for anyone who is interested in programming and
    wants to be prepared for a career in programming and technology. It
    has been more valuable than any other school of any kind that I have
    been to. Mr. Rob and SkilStak taught me so much and prepared me for
    even more. I wouldn't trade my experience there for anything in the
    world.

    Mur and I really, really believe in what Skilstak is about and what
    you are doing and have done for dozens of young boys and girls.
    Beyond the coding and the career preparation, Skilstak provides a ‘
    place‘ for them and gives them the courage to wear their nerd badges
    proudly.  I don’t think it’s hyperbole to say that the impact of
    Skilstak will last throughout their lives regardless of the
    trajectory each takes.

    I have enjoyed my time learning at Skilstak! My favorite thing is
    that we are always changing and learning the newest available
    material for web development. Most of my girl friends don’t like to
    talk about code, but it is because they don’t understand it. I have
    found other coding girls at Skilstak, I enjoy figuring out
    assignments together with them and also working at my own pace.

    started out in Code and Play and has progressed to Pro, gaining
    invaluable coding skills and knowledge every step of the way! In
    addition to classes, he has served as a TA or teacher’s assistant
    and aspires to be an instructor as his part-time job during his high
    school years. He has not only learned several coding languages, but
    has acquired a valuable work ethic and sense of community and active
    citizenship. I have no doubt, that he truly has discovered his
    lifelong passion and career path while attending classes at
    SkilStak.  I am extremely grateful to Rob for providing my son with
    his incredible coding abilities and life skills, and more
    importantly, for serving as a mentor and positive male role model to
    an impressionable teenager! I would wholeheartedly recommend the
    SkilStak program as an extracurricular activity to any future coders
    and their parents!

    Our quiet, unexcitable 11 year old son has been taking classes with
    Rob and his crew at Skilstak going on 3 1/2 years. These classes are
    a challenge that school can not provide. He says that they are just
    fun and he likes creating on the computer. But we see much more! We
    have seen him become more creative and analytical, confident,
    independent, and self-sufficient. Mr. Rob has opened his eyes to
    future job possibilities and the importance of professionalism and
    good character. As well as legitimate computer programming
    instruction. He can’t wait to go to the classes!

    These classes are more than standard ‘summer camp’ computer classes.
    Students are expected to actually learn different languages and
    create programs. They will get certified at their own pace. And the
    classes are challenging. We highly recommend Skilstak to anyone
    wanting to do more than ‘play on a computer’.

    Hey Rob, I’m a fairly new viewer and wanted to say thank you for the
    work you are doing to build your knowledge tools and the community
    around it.  But also for the free conversations and teachings you
    are providing on YouTube.  I agree 100% with your comments about
    Facebook and Google and think your knowledge projects are
    fascinating.  But I also identity with your recent wisdom  about
    mentoring and teaching.  I am 45 years old, graduated with a CS
    degree in 2002, but because of various reasons I did not do well in
    college and didn’t pursue programming until about 6 years ago.
    Through that pursuit I found a job which lead to a second job which
    had me working on projects with zero documentation with languages
    I did not know.   I struggled but eventually figured out what
    I needed to get the work done, fix bugs, and add features.  That was
    until I burned out February of last year.  Since then I’ve been on
    my own path of self learning and healing.

    So when I first heard you talk about what an autodidact was
    I realized that I’ve already been doing that because I’ve had too.
    And that I am being one now.  Your conversations about all this has
    given me context and validation.  So once again thank you for
    putting all this out there for people like me to see.

    You know what's funny, after joining this stream just a few days
    ago, I removed 95%+ of my twitch subs, and 99% of my youtube subs.
    Signal to Noise ratio is real, made me realize how much noise I was
    letting in. There are some true gurus I've also unsubbed just
    because, right now I have to admit I cannot benefit from all of
    them. It's not their fault they are just putting themselves out
    there. But it's the rare few who are guru-ish status who also can
    speak to newbs like myself.

    What I like most about Rob is that he is not a nerd. I can't stand

    you talk about your life, maybe because you have strong opinions,
    maybe because you understand life and things outside of coding.

    manipulate code, and saw how it connected seamlessly with Linux, It
    changed everything for me. No college degree, no education to speak
    of, but I got hired on for the city of San Diego, CA as a data entry
